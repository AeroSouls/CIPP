# Mailbox Restore Wizard

The Mailbox Restore Wizard is a tool that allows you to restore a soft-deleted mailbox to a target mailbox. Follow the steps below to perform a mailbox restore:

1. Select Tenant: Choose the tenant for which you want to restore the mailbox.
2. Select Soft-Deleted Mailbox: Identify the soft-deleted mailbox that you want to restore. This step involves selecting the mailbox from a list of soft-deleted mailboxes.
3. Select Target Mailbox: Specify the target mailbox where you want to restore the soft-deleted mailbox. This can be a user mailbox or shared mailbox.
4. Mailbox Restore Options: Configure additional options for the mailbox restore, such as the bad item limit. The bad item limit determines the number of corrupt or inaccessible items that can be skipped during the restore process.
5. Confirmation Page: Review the selected options and confirm the mailbox restore. This page provides a summary of the restore settings before proceeding with the restore operation.

Please note that the Mailbox Restore Wizard is a powerful tool and should be used with caution. Make sure to double-check the selected options before initiating the restore process.
