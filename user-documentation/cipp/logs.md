# Logbook

## **Overview**

The Logbook is a feature within CIPP that records and displays all actions performed by the system on a given day. This page is essential for monitoring and troubleshooting as it helps users track the execution of various tasks, identify issues, and confirm successful operations.

## **Using the Logbook for troubleshooting**&#x20;

Users can verify if specific actions have occurred by checking the log entries. For example, if a user wants to verify if a specific scheduled task, such as the "Hudu Extension Sync," was executed successfully. They select the appropriate date, use the filter to search for "Hudu Extension Sync," and review the log entries to confirm successful execution.

{% hint style="warning" %}
If an expected action is not logged, it might indicate a failure that occurred before the data was collected. If an alert is expected but not present in the logbook, it could indicate a failure in the data collection process. Such issues typically require developer intervention for identification and resolution. If you are a sponsor, please reach out to the helpdesk in these cases.
